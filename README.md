# Small-World-Phenomenon
Algorithms project based on graph theory, 
In this project, we will investigate this phenomenon on the movies' actors and actresses by 
measuring both the degree of separation and relation strength between any two actors/
actresses. 
Two actors or actresses are linked if they appeared in a movie together. The degree of 
separation between two actors/actresses is the shortest chain of links that leads one of them to 
the other.
